Hi,
Dear Resarcher 
The provided source code is based on the my paper entitled:
"Entropy-based security risk measurement for Android mobile applications." Soft Computing 23.16 (2019): 7303-7319. 
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-018-3377-5
The code is written in Matlab 2013. Data is also in Matlab file format(.mat).
Check them before use in your research.  
You can simply propose a new method for risk computation of mobile apps and compare it to my ERS(ERisk) method.

Best Regards,
Mahmood Deypir.
